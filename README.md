## Introduction
This project was created to gain an insight at looking at another person's pre-existing code.
As developers, it is not only important to be able to write our own code, but read others' and give feedback. 
Instead of giving feedback, I refactored their webpage HTML and CSS to reduce redundancy and increase clarity.

## Build Process
- Gain a clear understanding of acceptance criteria
- Review pre-existing HTML and CSS
- Begin by creating semantics for easily identifiable elements E.g. Header, Footer, main, title
- Proceed to change the nested divs to more specific elements E.g. figures, articles, nav
- As changes were made to the HTML, the webpage was referenced to check for any changes
- If anything did change, the CSS was checked for any corresponding elements that may be responsible, and vice versa
- Any redundant CSS selectors were consolidated
- Comments were added throughout both HTML and CSS files

## Usage
[Deployment](https://peterkim89.github.io/Horiseon-Webpage-Refactoring-Practice/)

After following the url, the webpage should look like the following image.
The links in the navigation cluster should redirect the page to their respective areas.
